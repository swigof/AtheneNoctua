## TODOS
* figure out function hooking/injection
* full application for just map tracking
* hash checks for client version, disable if not same
* scan for address instead of static. atleast take down instruction values to refind
* timestamps appended to all data
* address for shop name (or player name) on shop open to make finding merchant easier
* address for id on shop open and address for shop ids on map load to check which have dissapeared
* full item details including stats
* identical functions from shop opens but with owls
